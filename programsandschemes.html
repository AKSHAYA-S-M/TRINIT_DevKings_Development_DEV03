  The balance of actuarial premium is shared by the Central and State Governments on 50 : 50 basis.  The schemes are voluntary for States and available in areas and crops that are notified by the State Governments.   
 Further, the schemes are compulsory for loanee farmers and voluntary for non-loanee farmers. </p></li>

<li><a href="https://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/PSS%20GUIDELINES%20final.pdf">Price Support Scheme (PSS) for pulses and oilseeds</a><p>The Government's price policy for agricultural commodities seeks to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production and to safeguard the interest of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation.</p></li>
<li><a href="https://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines%20PDPS.pdf">Price Deficiency Payment  Scheme (PDPS)</a></li><br>
<li><a href="https://www.nabard.org/content1.aspx?id=602&catid=23&mid=23">Interest Subvention Scheme</a><p> The Government provides interest subvention of 3% on short-term crop loans up to Rs.3.00 lakh.
  Presently, loan is available to farmers at an interest rate of 7% per annum, which gets reduced to 4% on prompt repayment.  Further, under Interest Subvention Scheme 2016-17, in order to provide relief to the farmers on occurrence of natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% shall continue to be available to banks for the first year on the restructured amount. In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses against negotiable warehouse receipts, 
the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months post harvest on the same rate as available to crop loan.</p></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/English/Scripts/Notification.aspx?Id=2311">Kisan Credit Card (KCC)</a><p>c (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 for issue of Kisan Credit Cards to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that farmers may use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs.
</p></li>
<li><u><b>Soil Health Card Scheme:</b></u>
<br>
 Launched in 2015, the scheme has been introduced to assist State Governments to issue Soil Health Cards to all farmers in the country. 
 The Soil Health Cards provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil alongwith recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.
 As on 11.7.2017, against target of 253 lakh soil samples, all 253 lakh soil samples have been collected and 245 lakh (97%) samples have been tested.  
Against target of 12 crore Soil Health Cards, so far 9 crore (76%) cards have been distributed to farmers.</li>
<br>
<li> <u><b> Neem Coated Urea (NCU):</b></u>
<br><br>
 Scheme being promoted to regulate use of urea, enhance availability of nitrogen to the crop and reduce cost of fertilizer application.  NCU slows down the release of fertilizer and makes it available to the crop in an effective manner. The entire quantity of domestically manufactured and imported urea is now neem coated. 
The reports from field are positive. The expected saving is 10% of urea consumption, thereby resulting in reduced cost of cultivation and improved soil health management.</li>
<br>
<li> <u><b>Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana  (PKVY):</b></u>
      <br>
 Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is being implemented with a view to promote organic farming in the country.
  This will improve soil health and organic matter content and increase net income of the farmer so as to realise premium prices. 
Under this scheme, an area of 5 lakh acre is targeted to be covered though 10,000 clusters of 50 acre each, from the year 2015-16 to 2017-18.
 So far 7208 clusters have been formed and remaining  clusters would be formed during 2017-18. </li>
